# Pokémon Data Analysis

## Introduction

This repository contains a detailed analysis of Pokémon data, exploring various aspects such as the relationship between legendary status and performance, type-based statistical strengths, and generational trends in Pokémon stats. The analysis is performed using Python and presented in a Google Colab Notebook format.

## Overview

The analysis covers the following key areas:
- **Relationship Between Legendary Status and Total Performance**: Evaluates whether legendary Pokémon have higher average total stats compared to non-legendary Pokémon.
- **Stats Based on Pokémon Types**: Investigates the average stats of different Pokémon types to identify strengths and weaknesses.
- **Stats Distribution Across Generations**: Analyzes the trends in Pokémon stats across different generations, highlighting notable findings such as Generation 2 having the lowest average total stats and Generation 4 having the highest.

## Repository Contents

- `pokemon_analysis.ipynb`: The Google Colab Notebook containing the full analysis, including data visualization and insights.
- `Pokemon.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis, containing information about various Pokémon, their stats, types, and other attributes.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Getting Started

To view and run the analysis on Google Colab, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a Google account to access Google Colab.

### Usage

1. **Open the Google Colab Notebook**:
   - Go to the following URL to open the notebook in Google Colab: [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18xM3U2ffj2dkKKqUsqFOB8Hb9cq0PJ6l?usp=sharing).

2. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Once the notebook is open in Google Colab, you can run each cell sequentially to execute the analysis.
   - Make sure to upload the `Pokemon.csv` file to the Colab environment if it's not already accessible from a URL.

### Example Code for Loading Data in Colab

If the dataset is hosted online, you can use the following code snippet to load it directly into the notebook:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset from a URL
url = 'https://path/to/Pokemon.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Display the first few rows of the dataframe
df.head()
```
## Insights
Key insights from the analysis include:

- Legendary Pokémon generally have higher total stats, supporting their perceived superiority.
- Dragon type Pokémon exhibit the highest average stats, indicating their overall strength.
- Generational analysis reveals that Generation 4 Pokémon have the highest average total stats, while Generation 2 Pokémon have the lowest.
